mapbiographer
=============

LOUIS Map Biographer (LMB) lets users conduct in-person map-based interviews with local land users and simultaneously record audio.

LMB requires the pyaudio library to record audio; install this library before installing Map Biographer. Map Biographer uses the oggenc2 program to convert audio .wav files to .ogg files when exporting to LOUIS Heritage. Oggenc2 can be installed after Map Biographer is installed but configuration in the Manager interface is required.

In version 1.1 sketch mode has been added to provide natural way to draw line and area features by Red Layer and Multiline Join QGIS plugins; please install them before installing Map Biographer.

In version 1.1.3 the navigator panel was replaced by a tool bar to save screen space and give a larger effective size to the map.

In version 1.2.x various improvements were made to importing transcripts and in communication with the LOUIS Heritage web service.
