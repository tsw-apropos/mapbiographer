mapbiographer
=============

LOUIS Map Biographer (LMB) lets users conduct in-person map-based interviews with local land users and simultaneously record audio.

LMB requires the pyaudio library to fully function. It also requires the oggenc2 software for compression of audio files for upload to Heritage or export. 
In version 1.1 sketch mode as added that requires the Red Layer and Multiline Join QGIS plugins.
