mapbiographer
=============

LOUIS Map Biographer (LMB) lets users conduct in-person map-based interviews with local land users and simultaneously record audio.

LMB requires the pyaudio library to record audio; install this library before installing Map Biographer. Map Biographer uses the oggenc2 program to convert audio .wav files to .ogg files when exporting to LOUIS Heritage. Oggenc2 can be installed after Map Biographer is installed but configuration in the Manager interfaces is required.

In version 1.1 sketch mode has been added to provide natural way to draw line and area features by Red Layer and Multiline Join QGIS plugins; please install them before installing Map Biographer.
